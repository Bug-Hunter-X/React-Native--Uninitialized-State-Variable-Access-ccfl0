This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is common when using functional components with useState hook.  The problem is that the useState hook returns an array, where the first element is the current state value, and the second is a function to update the state. When the component initially renders, the state value might not yet be set to its initial value. 
```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(count); // Might be undefined initially
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text> 
    </View>
  );
}
```
