# React Native Uninitialized State Variable Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized using the useState hook. This can lead to unexpected behavior, often resulting in undefined values or application crashes.

## Problem
The `useState` hook's state variable isn't immediately available when the component first mounts.  Trying to access it before it's populated leads to an 'undefined' value. This example shows the issue and a robust solution.

## Solution
The solution involves using optional chaining or conditional rendering to gracefully handle the scenario where the state variable is not yet initialized.
